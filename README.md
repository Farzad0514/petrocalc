## Installation

```bash
pip install petrocalc
```

Or for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/petrocalc.git
cd petrocalc
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
import petrocalc

# Drilling calculations
mud_gradient = petrocalc.drilling.mud_weight_to_pressure_gradient(12.0, "ppg")
hydrostatic_pressure = petrocalc.drilling.hydrostatic_pressure(12.0, 10000, "ppg")

# Reservoir engineering
oil_fvf = petrocalc.reservoir.oil_formation_volume_factor_standing(
    gas_oil_ratio=500, gas_gravity=0.7, oil_gravity=35, 
    temperature=180, pressure=2500
)

# Production analysis
oil_rate = petrocalc.production.vogel_ipr(
    reservoir_pressure=3000, bottomhole_pressure=2000, maximum_oil_rate=1000
)

# Fluid properties
water_fvf = petrocalc.fluids.water_formation_volume_factor(
    temperature=180, pressure=2500, salinity=50000
)

# Rock properties
porosity = petrocalc.rock_properties.porosity_from_density_log(
    bulk_density=2.3, matrix_density=2.65, fluid_density=1.0
)

# Economic analysis
npv = petrocalc.economics.net_present_value(
    cash_flows=[100000, 150000, 120000, 90000], 
    discount_rate=0.1, 
    initial_investment=500000
)
```

## Detailed Usage Examples

### Drilling Engineering Example

```python
from petrocalc import drilling

# Calculate mud weight required for a given formation pressure
formation_pressure = 5000  # psi
depth = 10000  # ft
required_mud_weight = formation_pressure / (0.052 * depth)

print(f"Required mud weight: {required_mud_weight:.1f} ppg")

# Calculate annular velocity for hole cleaning
flow_rate = 400  # gpm
hole_diameter = 8.5  # inches
pipe_diameter = 5.0  # inches
ann_velocity = drilling.annular_velocity(flow_rate, hole_diameter, pipe_diameter)

print(f"Annular velocity: {ann_velocity:.1f} ft/min")
```

### Reservoir Engineering Example

```python
from petrocalc import reservoir

# Calculate bubble point pressure
bubble_point = reservoir.bubble_point_pressure_standing(
    gas_oil_ratio=600,
    gas_gravity=0.75,
    oil_gravity=32,
    temperature=180
)

print(f"Bubble point pressure: {bubble_point:.0f} psia")

# Decline curve analysis
initial_rate = 1000  # bbl/day
time = 2  # years
decline_rate = 0.15  # annual
current_rate = reservoir.arps_decline_curve(initial_rate, time, decline_rate)

print(f"Production rate after {time} years: {current_rate:.0f} bbl/day")
```

### Economic Analysis Example

```python
from petrocalc import economics

# Project economics analysis
cash_flows = [200000, 180000, 160000, 140000, 120000]  # Annual cash flows
initial_investment = 800000
discount_rate = 0.12

npv = economics.net_present_value(cash_flows, discount_rate, initial_investment)
irr = economics.internal_rate_of_return(cash_flows, initial_investment)
payback = economics.discounted_payback_period(cash_flows, discount_rate, initial_investment)

print(f"NPV: ${npv:,.0f}")
print(f"IRR: {irr:.1%}")
print(f"Payback period: {payback:.1f} years")
```
